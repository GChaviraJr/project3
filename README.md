# Night-Owl

Night Owl is an app that allows you to search for locations within a city, choose which one to go to, and book an Uber ride at the click of a button. 

This app was collaborated on a Linux Docker Container which was uploaded to DockerHub, created using JavaScript, React.js, React Portals, Redis, MongoDB (Mongoose), JWT, BCrypt, Yelp API, and Uber API.
